Reflections

Question
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Thoughts
1. Changed lines are highlighted so you can focus only on the relevant areas
2. Clearly marked additions with + sign

Question
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Thoughts
1. Very quick roll back
2. Complex undo  

Question
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Thoughts
Pros
1. Greater control over size of commit
2. Able to ad meaningful message to each commit
3. Better history

Cons
1. Must remember to commit

Question
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Thoughts
Google docs is designed to allow the user to work on a single file at a time. It makes sense that in most cases the changes to a single file need to be tracked with no relation to changes in other files. The concept of a group of files all belonging to the same project is simply not needed by a word processing application.

Git on the other hand is designed for code which is usually made up of mant files that are all related to each other. That is, the file is just a component of something larger. The entire programme made up of all the files may be viewed as a single artifact that the programmer is creating. And we would like to see a history of the changes to the whole rather than the parts.

Question
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Thoughts
Git log shows all commits in the history of a repository. Git diff shows the changes between one commit and another.

Question
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Thoughts
It is easy to undo the past. Now you can time travel back to a time when the code worked. This way you a free to experiment as much as possible knowing that you can find any previously working version of the code.
