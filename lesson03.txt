Question
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Thoughts
This way the code is avaiable from any computer, simply fetch the code and work on it. Also, multiple programmers may work on the same repository.

Question
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Thoughts
Sometimes you may be in the middle of a code change and do not need to update to the latest version. Remember that in most cases multiple  programmers are working on the repository. If the remote pushed changes to your local automatically you may suddenly get merge conflicts or unexpected changes to your file. Better to choose when you wish to pull.

Question
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Thoughts
A fork is a clone that GitHub performs on their servers for you. It allows them to track which repositories have been forked from which. 
A branch is a named commit point within a repository.
A clone is a copy of a repository. Either remote or local.

Question
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Thoughts
Makes it easy to tel if the local repository is getting out of sync with the remote without having to fetch. Also, determining what may have happened since the last pull or push would be easier.

Question
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Thoughts
On code? I wouldn't want to collaborate with GitHub or equivalent. For other things we use Google Docs, Trello etc.
